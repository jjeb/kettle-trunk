 <!-- ALL the plugins are loaded based on the entries on this file.  Currently, two types of entries are supported: folder or jar files.
 	A plugin folder may contain:
 	1- Subfolders with plugin definitions (plugin.xml and relevant class files packaged in a jar file.)
 	2- Jar files that represent plugins themselves and follow the same file hierarchy as folder plugins.
 	
 	Likewise, an entry pointing to a jar file should have the same file organization as a folder-based plugin entry.
