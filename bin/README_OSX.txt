Dear OSX user,

We did a series of bug-fixes lately for all kinds of issues that annoyed our OSX users.
Most of these have been fixed.
We even made an installation image (.dmg) for the people that like to fire Spoon without too much to think about.

If you read this message however, here are the installation instructions:

After unzipping the distribution (which you did since you are reading this message) you can launch Spoon by running "sh spoon.sh" from a Terminal window.

Since we now have a test system you are even more encouraged to report problems on our JIRA system:

All the best

The development team
