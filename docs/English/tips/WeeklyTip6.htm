<TITLE>The Weekly Kettle Tip #6: Handling Binary (BLOB) data</TITLE>
<BODY>
Hi Kettle fans,
<p>Yesterday, Kettle developer and allround great guy Sven Boden commited some very interesting stuff to the Kettle codebase: support for LOB, BLOB and other Binary database objects.<br>
The <A CLASS="interwiki" TITLE="CRQ-1644: Supporting Large Objects (LOBs); Status: New; Last Modified: 2006-08-18 12:21; Priority: Normal" HREF="/proj/tracker/itemDetails.do?task_id=1644">feature request</A> behind this has been hanging around for some time now.
</p>
<p>If you get a hold of the <a class="external" href="http://www.javaforge.com/displayDocument/kettle.jar?doc_id=3719">latest kettle.jar</a>, you too can help us test this new functionality.<br>
Currently we're testing on MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and Firebird although we're sure the code will work for more than just those databases.
</p>
<p>The test transformation is the primary reason why I'm writing this short Weekly Kettle Tip: how do we load the content of a file into a binary value object?<br>
Well, this is where Javascript is coming to our rescue once again.<br>
Here is the code to do it:
</p>
<p>

<pre>
  file = new Packages.java.io.File(filename.getString());  
  fileInputStream = new Packages.java.io.FileInputStream(file);
  var content = Packages.be.ibridge.kettle.core.Const.createByteArray(file.length());
  fileInputStream.read(content, 0, file.length());
  fileInputStream.close();
</pre>

</p>
<p><img class="inline" src="images/load-images.png" alt="The transformation to load the images" />
</p>
<p><i><b>The example <a href="files/Load images and store into database table.ktr">here</a> loads all PNG image files in a certain directory and stores them into a database table.</b></i>
</p>
<p>So there you are, it's that simple!  from now on, we should not be afraid to store and retrieve binary content.
</p>
<p>Until next time,
</p>
<p>Matt
</p>
<p>P.S. Don't hesitate to create <a href="http://www.javaforge.com/proj/tracker.do?proj_id=318">bug reports</a> for this brand new feature.  <b>The more bug repors we get, the sooner we can fix what's broken!</b></p>
