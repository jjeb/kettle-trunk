<Title>The Weekly Kettle Tip #2: Quick pointers</Title>
<body>
This weeks Kettle tip was not written by me or one of the Kettle developers. 
It comes from people in Daytona Beach (FL) that have been using Kettle for a while now.  
I'm reposting their experiences and pointers unchanged (with permission) in the hope 
that it will help others.

<h2>Pointers using Kettle.</h2>
<h3>Setting</h3>
We were new to using Kettle and want to use kettle as an ETL tool to load a
datawarehouse from 50 different sources.

<h3>Mapping</h3>
1st misconception - Assumed mapping meant mapping one field to another (i.e.
pulling data from a source table and mapping it to a destination table). <br>
To peform this type of Mapping use the Select Value Step (this allows you to
extract data from source and pass it on to the successor step (i.e. map
input field name to output field name)).
<h3>Constant values</h3>
Use of Constant Step - allows you to map a fixed value to an output step
(i.e. say you have a field STATE and you want to put FL in each record in
the destination table, you would use a constant step). <br>
In the constant step you can map many constants/fixed values with one step.

<h3>Table Output</h3>
Not all field in the destination table have to have a value put into them.<br>
The tool may give you warnings (in the validation step), but its not
necessary to have every field in the destination have a value being passed
it.
<h3>Commit size</h3>
To improve performance of transformations, add the value to the commit size
in the table output step.<br><br>
Example:<br>
<br>
If commit size is specified an appropriate size in the "Table Output" step,
this will cause major boost to performance of a transformation.<br>
We were testing with 5000 records, using the default size of 0, it took 160 seconds.<br>
Increasing the size to 1000 made the process run in 3.5 seconds. <br>
